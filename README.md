# Mona
Simple shiny app demonstrating the SVD of a matrix.  In this case the "matrix" is a raster of a small,
black & white rendering of da Vinci's Mona Lisa.  By varying the range and number of singular values
retained in the reconstruction, one sees how the vertical lines in the painting are dominant.  Small
singular value components account for edges in the image and, to a lesser extent, cracks in the paint itself.
